                <p class="text"><strong>Information Technology</strong> is one of the biggest and fastest growing fields of study in the nation. As technology begins to play a larger role in our lives, the demand for IT professionals grows at an exponential rate. This job market with having virtually nothing to lose, finding a job after school has never been easier than it is for an IT professional.</p>
                <p class="text">Here at Georgia Southern, we have built up an extraordinary group of IT professionals to help guide and teach our students to become the best in the field. With our <strong>big campus, small feel</strong>, each student is almost guaranteed one on one time with each professor they have. Activities in the classroom focus on hands on work and getting the experience you need to lead a successful career. Our students are pushed to their limits in order to learn and understand each concept to the best of their ability.</p>

                <p class="text">One thing that is unique to Georgia Southern is how diverse not only each classroom is, but the campus as a whole. We have been striving to increase our <strong>diversity</strong> in the classroom, and especially in the IT department. We have several professors that come from across the world that all bring their own unique character to the classroom. Our IT student body is also increasingly becoming more and more diverse with every semester that goes by. We are determined to make the IT industry a diverse, welcoming environment for everyone to enjoy and be a part of.</p>

             <p class="text"><strong>Women</strong> in the IT world is something that is beginning to steadily increase as the overall demand increases. At Georgia Southern, we donâ€™t only welcome, we encourage any and all students to look into the IT department, regardless of sex or gender. This department is targeted towards the people who have interest in becoming an IT professional. </p>
              <p class="text">Our academic alliances with <strong>industry partners</strong> provide IT majors with experience using state of the art equipment with access to professional level software. In addition, we offer IT Internship and Co-Op programs to assure that students are <strong>WORK-READY</strong> when they graduate.</p>

We aspire to integrate student learning and personal and career development into a holistic educational experience and to prepare our students to be leaders in a global community. We envision expanding our intentionally <strong>collaborative</strong> relationships with our colleagues and families to inspire seamless learning environments which are dedicated to nurturing the whole student. In accomplishing these goals, we esteem to be a role model in the areas of enrollment management and student affairs across the country by creating and implementing innovative programs and services.</p>
